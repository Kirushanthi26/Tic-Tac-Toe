Which Folder Should You Use to store image?

You should use the public/ folder for any images that should not be handled 
by the build process and that should be generally available. 
Good candidates are images used directly in the index.html file or favicons.

On the other hand, images that are used inside of components should typically be stored in the src/ folder 
(e.g., in src/assets/).

--------------------------------------------------
if your new state depends on your previous state value, you should not update the state like this
setIsEditing(!isEditing)

instead, pass a function to your state updating function. 
this function will automatically be called by react and will receive the guaranteed latest state value.
setIsEditing((editing) => !editing)

---------------------------------------------

 setGameBoard(prevGameBoard) => 
      const updatedBoard = [...prevGameBoard.map((innerArray)=>[...innerArray])]   =====> obj prev store 
      updatedBoard[rowIndex][colIndex] = 'X'
      return updatedBoard

--------------------------------------------------
if we want to pass the paramter for handle function 

onClick={()=>handleSelectSquare(rowIndex, colIndex)}
